# Smart Meter App


## Setup
* Using ![React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started) 


## Graphs & Charts

Using Victory Native for ios and android and Victory for web. This isn't officially supported. 

See https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/faq/#expo-web-apps-that-use-victory-native

## Develop

When running on Android simulator, need to start the virtual device first. 


## Storage 

React native async storage https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install/



## Notes 
on using some packages, will get compiler warnings saying component can't be found, see https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/1030#issuecomment-1001449665. These warnings are resolved by setting ```GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false``` in *.env* file.
